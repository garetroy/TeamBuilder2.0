 ***Development Documentation***

 This section is dedicated to answering questions that pertain to
 extending the Team Builder application. 

 First, before extending the code base for Team Builder, make sure 
 that you have familiarized yourself with the testing suite and 
 thoroughly read through the readme located in that directory. 

 As it is impossible for us to predict all of the desired extensions
 that a future developer may seek to add to this project, we can only
 do our best in addressing the issues/questions that are most likely 
 to arrise. If there are any remaining unanswered questions, feel 
 free to contact us directly for further assistance. 

 What follows is an overview of some of the most likely areas to be
 considered for extension and the types of concerns and dependencies
 that must be taken into consideration. 

 **Gui**
 -Requires guiinterface
 
 The gui was created with the developer in mind, so it is simple to modify and
 tweak the program to the individuals liking. Most of the logic is contained
 within the gui interface. 

 The centerWindow function does as you expect, it centers the window,
 the only difference being that if notself is given, it assumes
 that the window given is going to be a smaller screen (such as a login or 
 a loading screen), and changes the size then centers the given window.

 startWindow set's up the basic setup for all windows, centering the window
 and setting the style.

    **Start UI**
    All UI components dealing with layout will be commented in a readable format
    where it will have a # letting you know where the created frame is starting
    and ending. Most frames will be self explanitory in this way and will not
    be explained unless some odd things are contained within the function.

    emailTeams stores everything needed into the guiInterface (expecially if the
    user desires to have the email/password saved).
    
    In loadingScreen it is important to know that it disables all buttons
    for the current frame.

 In submitFiles we are checking to see if the paths exists and are also
 checking if the team size values are valid.

 checkThread was important to implement, so we would know when to get rid
 of the current loading screen. It just calls itself every second to check
 if it is dead, and if it is, it calls the given function.

 All filebrowsers work the same, they just look for different types of 
 file extensions, chaning the corresponding label to what was given 

    **ThreadedTask**
    This is just our thread pool for threaded tasks. This is important
    for the smooth running of the gui.
 
 **GUI Interface**
 -requires day
 -requires team
 -requires student
 -requires inform
 -requires algorithm
 -requires iomanager
 -requires configdata
 
 A lot of these functions are pretty self explanitory trhoguh their names,
 but will still be described if they are doing something funky. 

 reShuffleSelectedTeams takes in a corresponding list of indexes to teams.
 It utilizes the swapMembers algorithm and then appends the newly shuffled
 teams to the end of the list

 sendEmail has a lot of moving parts. The only thing required for paramaters
 is teams. This is because if the user already specified to temporarily
 store their email/password, then we wouldn't have to keep passing those 
 parameters. The rest of the block of code simply just sends emails to the
 corresponding teams and if specifided, stores the email and password
 for ease of use

 **IO Management**

 It is very likely that a developer may want to extend this project
 to be capable of handling different types of input and output. Fortunately, 
 this is a rather easy objective as IO is entirely contained with a single module, 
 iomanager.py (I will, from here on, refer to this module as the IO manager). 

 The IO manager is designed to make extension as painless as possible. If 
 you wish to add a new method for reading or writing, there are really only 
 three steps to consider (four, if you include testing). The first step is to 
 creat a new method within the IO manager that will handle the new reading 
 or writing. 


   __IMPORTANT__: all writers must take the following form--

   myWriter(self, path, teams)

   where 'myWriter' is replaced with the name of your new write method, path
   is the system path to the output file (file name included), and teams is a 
   list of Team objects. 

   In the same manner, all readers must take the following form--

   myReader(self, path)

   where 'myReader' is replaced with the name of your new read method, and 
   path is the system path to the file to be read in. 

 
 The second step in creating a new reader or writer is to add this new method
 to the appropriate reader/writer dictionary (both located in the initializer).
 There are two dictionaries for this purpose, one for writers and one for readers. 
 Each dictionary associates a reader/writer name, respectively, with the a pointer
 to the associated method. For instance, if I created a new reader called dataBaseReader,
 I would add this reader to the dictionary as follows:

 self.\_\_readers = {'dataBase' : self.dataBaseReader}

 Note that, in this example, there are no other readers in the dictionary. This will
 not be the case. You will instead be adding your reader in to a collection of readers
 within the dictionary. Also, 'dataBase' is an arbitrary name that I made up. There
 are no established conventions on the naming of these readers or there dictionary keys, 
 as long as they are understandable to a new user. 

 The final step is to add the name/key of your reader/writer (the name you are using as a 
 key in the dictionary) to the list of accepted input or output. These lists are also 
 located within the initializer. 

 For instance, following the above example, I would add the key in the following manner:

 self.\_\_accepted\_in = ['dataBase', '']

 Again, this example is unrealistic, as there are no other elements in the list, but this
 gives you an idea of the simple process for extending IO management. 

 And that's it! You have now added a new read/write method to the Team Builder project!



 **Filter Changing**
 
 A filter allows for a developer to add more things to compare or how to compare two 
 students on certain criteria. To develop (or modify) a filter is made pretty easy.

   __IMPORTANT__: all filters must have the following form--
   myFilter(student1, student2)

   'Filtername'

   student1 and student2 are the students that we are taking in, they variables can be 
   named differently. Filtername is the ID that you want to give the filter, which will
   be used to recieve the cresidentails from the individual students.

   Filtername will be added to the student at IO for the filters that you want to import

At the end the filter must return a score for the two students.


**Algorithm**
Modifying the algorithm allows for one to change the way that the algorithm matches/ranks teams
-Requires Students
-Requires Teams

The init funciton makes some defaults, team_size is the size of teams that we want, k is the amount of permutations of teams we want, and d and n are what allow you to adjust the accuraccy of the algorithm (the amount of swaps and rescoring)

initTeamSet takes a set of students and creates random teams, returning as a list. Everytime a team's min size is full, it adds it to the list and starts creating a new list. Currently, if there are more people left over (cannot fill up teams) than there are teams, it will throw an error, if not it will just throw them all into a team and return them. Then it returns all the list's of teams

weightCalc takes a team and adds up the team weights and "normalizes them" by the team size. 

getWeight runs the filters for the two students and returns the total weight.

swapMembers takes in a list of teams and swaps students in the teams with the min and max scores, then swaps them. This provides for a better average. Returning the new list of teams

deviation takes in a list of teams, and returns an integer of the total deviation of a team.


runMain is the big one. This creates k team sets, and puts them into a list called grouping_list. After that it iterates d times to re arrange the grouping_list to create better and better averages. After it is done it goes through the list, finds the minimum deviation of teams, and returns the corresponding list of teams. 


**Student**
Modifying student will allow for different cresidentials
-requires day

   __IMPORTANT__: all added items to a student will be through filters.

eq can be modified on how students are compared and str can be modified to create a string of the class differently

**Team**
Modifying team allows for differnt teamsizes and modify the behavior of the methods
-requires day
-requires Student

Within the init you will be able to change the defaults of the minimum and maximum team size. 

deepCopy allows for a full copy of memory of one team to another team

eq and str can be modified as desired. 

**Day**
Modifying day will allow you to change the way that times are compared/read/changed

days overloaders can be changed to provide for different behaviors. 

insertTime will add a time to the list of times in the class, as removeTime's will do the opposite
